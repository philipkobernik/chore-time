== Chore Time

Manage your household's chore chart and notify members weekly of their exciting house duties.

Goals: 

1. Extremely easy to create a chore chart in the browser. Rich UX via snappy interactive backbone JS interface.

2. Sleek public-facing view for household computers to use as their homepage.

3. Members can mark their chores as 'done' via a text message. This gets them a gold star.
